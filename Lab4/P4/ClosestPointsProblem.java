            Given a set of n points in plane, where each point has known coordinates (x,y).
            Find the two points that are closest together.
            The program reads input data from text files with the following structure:
            The first line contains the value of n, the number of points.
            The next n lines contain each line contains two integers representing the values of x[i], y[i].

            The output must show:
            - one pair of points that are at minimum distance (these points are not necessarily unique!), and
            - the value of the minimum distance.
