            Given a set of n rectangular buildings, having the bottoms on a fixed line, draw the skyline of
            these buildings, eliminating hidden lines.
            A building Bi is represented as a triplet (Li, Hi, Ri)
            A skyline of a set of n buildings is a list of x coordinates and the heights connecting them.
            The program reads input data from text files with the following structure:
            The first line contains the value of n, the number of buildings.
            For the next n lines, each line contains three integers, reprsesenting Li, Hi, Ri for each building.

            For example, if we have n=8 buildings with positions:
            (1,11,5), (2,6,7), (3,13,9), (12,7,16), (14,3,25), (19,18,22), (23,13,29), (24,4,28)
            The output is a skyline defined by following segments:
            (1, 11), (3, 13), (9, 0), (12, 7), (16, 3), (19, 18), (22, 3), (23, 13), (29, 0)
